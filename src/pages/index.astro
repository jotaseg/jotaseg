      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        In 2016, I started diving headfirst into the world of web development.
        Armed with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I began my exploration of
        what coding offered. Similar to falling down a rabbit hole, I quickly
        became captivated by the potential and creativity that coding and web
        development provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I've been honing my skills and learning everything I could.
        From building websites with a CMS to the development of mobile apps,
        I've gained invaluable experience and a deep passion for crafting
        exceptional digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of right now, I'm seeking new opportunities to apply my knowledge,
        open to full-time positions or freelance gigs, ready to contribute. As a
        web developer, I leverage my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a
        range of modern frameworks to create responsive, user-friendly, and
        visually appealing websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not immersed in the IDE or reading docs, I enjoy drinking <a

        >
        with <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant#Argentina_and_Uruguay"
          >medialunas</a
        >, and strategizing my way to victory in Hearts of Iron 4, trying to
        conquer the world. I also love hitting the gym to stay active, riding my
        bike, and watching football, my favorite sport.
